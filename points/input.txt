Please Inspect Your Order Upon Arrival

Once your package arrives, we kindly ask that you inspect all items to ensure everything in your order is present, in good condition, and functioning properly.

Please retain all shipping boxes, packing materials, and vendor packaging, and refrain from completing any warranty cards until your inspection is fully completed

If any item is defective or damaged, contact us within 5 business days of delivery to be eligible for a full refund.
After 5 business days, we'll provide a replacement of the same model or the manufacturer's equivalent, rather than a refund.
